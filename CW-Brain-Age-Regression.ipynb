    "Predicting the age of patient from a brain MRI scan can have diagnostic value for a number of diseases that may cause structural changes and potential damage to the brain. A discrepancy between the predicted age and the real, chronological age of a patient might indicate the presence of disease. This requires an accurate predictor of brain age which may be learned from a set of healthy reference subjects, given their brain MRI data and their actual age.\n",

    "The objective for the coursework is to implement different supervised learning approaches for age regression from brain MRI. We provided data from a total of 652 healthy subjects, that is split into different development sets and a held-out test set on which you will evaluate your final prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each approach will require a processing pipeline with different components that you will need to implement using methods that were discussed in the lectures and tutorials. There are three dedicated parts in the Jupyter notebook for each approach which contain some detailed instructions and some helper code.\n",

    "You may find some useful ideas and implementations in the tutorial notebooks. Once you have implemented all approaches and obtained results from your experiments, we ask you to write a short summary report. The reports should contain a short introduction, description of each of your methods and the individual processing steps, your results with a brief discussion. The report should also include some figures and plots to support your findings.\n",

    "## Part A: Volume-based regression using brain structure segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach aims to regress the age of a subject using the volumes of brain tissues as features. The brain structures include grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is known that with increasing age the ventricles enlarge (filled with CSF), while it is assumed that grey and white matter volume may decrease over time. However, as overall brain volume varies across individuals, taking the absolute volumes of tissues might not be predictive. Instead, relative volumes need to be computed as the ratios between each tissue volume and overall brain volume. To this end, a four-class (GM, WM, CSF, and background) brain segmentation needs to be implemented which will be trained using a total of 52 subjects (47 for training, 5 for validation). The segmentation method is then applied to the remaining 600 brain scans which will be used to train and test the age regression. Brain masks are provided which have been generated with a state-of-the-art neuroimaging brain extraction tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different regression techniques should be explored, and it might be beneficial to investigate what the best set of features is for this task. Are all volume features equally useful, or is it even better to combine some of them and create new features. How does a simple linear regression perform compared to a model with higher order polynomials? Do you need regularisation? How about other regression methods such as regression trees, SVMs or neural networks? The accuracy of different methods should be evaluated using two-fold cross-validation on the set of 500 subjects, and average age prediction accuracy should be compared and reported appropriately. The final prediction accuracy will be evaluated on a hold-out set of 100 subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* For part A, only the MR images and the brain masks should be used from the imaging data. The spatially normalised grey matter maps are used in part B and C only. If you struggle with task A-1, you can continue with A-2 using the provided reference segmentations in subfolder `segs_refs`."

    "Implement a CNN model for brain tissue segmentation which can provide segmentations of GM, WM, and CSF. For this task (and only for this task), we provide a subset of 52 subjects which are split into 47 images for training and 5 for validation. The template code below has the data handling and main training routines already implemented, so you can focus on implementing a suitable CNN model. A simple model is provided, but this won't perform very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your model is trained and you are happy with the results on the validation data you should apply it to the 500 subjects later used for training the age regressor. We provide reference segmentations in a subfolder `segs_refs` for all subjects. Calculate Dice similarity coefficients per tissue when comparing your predicted segmentations to the reference segmentations. Summarise the statistics of the 500 Dice scores for each tissue class in [box-and-whisker-plots](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html).\n",

    "*Note:* Implementing a full-fledged machine learning pipeline with training and testing procedures in Jupyter notebooks is a bit cumbersome and a pain to debug. Also, running bigger training tasks can be unstable. The code below should work as is on your VM.

    "The second approach will make use of grey matter maps that have been already extracted from the MRI scans and aligned to a common reference space to obtain spatially normalised maps. For this, we have used an advanced, state-of-the-art neuroimaging toolkit, called SPM12. The reference space corresponds to the commonly used MNI atlas as seen in the lecture on image segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these grey matter maps are spatially normalised (ie., registered), voxel locations across images from different subjects roughly correspond to the same anatomical locations. This means that each voxel location in the grey matter maps can be treated as an individual feature. Because those maps are quite large at their full resolution there would be a very large number of features to deal with (more than 850,000). A dimensionality reduction may need to be performed before training a suitable regressor on the low-dimensional feature representation. We will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to do the dimensionality reduction. It might also be beneficial to apply some pre-processing (downsampling, smoothing, etc.) before running PCA, which should be explored. The implemented pipeline should be evaluated using two-fold cross-validation using the same data splits as in part A for the 500 subjects, so the two different approaches can be directly compared in terms average age prediction accuracy.\n",
