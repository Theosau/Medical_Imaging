This repository contains the Machine Learning for Imaging coursework from the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, Academic Year 2019-2020, delivered by Dr Ben Glocker and Professor Daniel Rueckert. The coursework was developed with their PhD students.

This coursework and git repo is my joint work with Alvaro Prat.

Highlights:
  - Designed 3D Residual CNNs and classical ML regression methods for 3D brain MRI segmentation and patient age regression.
  - Developed a statistical up-sampling methodology to balance the input data distribution.

Please find the coursework description in the specs.pdf file, the developed solution in Brain-Age-Regression.ipynb and the final report in report.pdf.
